# Expense_Tracker
Expense_Tracker
This project aims to simulate an expense tracker for an individual using the Faker library. The project generates realistic monthly expense data, processes and stores it in a SQL database, and creates SQL queries to derive insights into spending behavior. A Streamlit app is developed to visualize these insights and showcase the results of SQL queries. The tracker will highlight expenses across categories like bills, groceries, subscriptions, and personal spending, providing a comprehensive overview of financial habits over a year.
